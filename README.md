# netflix_shiny
R Shiny based dashboard to analyze Netflix View History data

- Exploratory analysis of Netflix usage by account
- Overlaid timeline of viewing sessions to spot concurrent usage patterns
- Heatmap of views visualized on a map (potential anamoly detection)

*TODO: Port view-time by device-type analysis from kaggle notebook and add reactive chart*
